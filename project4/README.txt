Assignment Instructions:

Update the binary search tree example from class. As is, it creates a BinaryTree<int> that tested
via a menu. A script file will be provided to demonstrate its use. Then, complete a Term-specific tree traversal routine in
its concrete subclass TermTree, which inherits BinaryTree<Term>. Update the application to work with Term data
instead of int.
