Data Structures, Dr. Spiegel, Fall 2022

This repository contains projects created for Data Structures, a required class for my major I took in the Fall 2022 semester. All of the assignments
for this class were coded in C++. The assignments focus on untilizing various data structures to store and manipulate data, such as vectors, linked lists,
binary trees, and arrays. Projects 3 and 4 include Doxygen web pages with documentation, which can be found at https://csit.kutztown.edu/~jmora678/csc237/.
Links to the individual project's Doxygen pages can be found in the READMEs of each project's folder.
